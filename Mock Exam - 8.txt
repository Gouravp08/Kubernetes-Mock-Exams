We recently deployed a DaemonSet called logs-cka26-trb under kube-system namespace in cluster2 for collecting logs from all the cluster nodes including the controlplane node. However, at this moment, the DaemonSet is not creating any pod on the controlplane node.


Troubleshoot the issue and fix it to make sure the pods are getting created on all nodes including the controlplane node.

Ans:
---
Check the status of DaemonSet

kubectl --context2 cluster2 get ds logs-cka26-trb -n kube-system
You will find that DESIRED CURRENT READY etc have value 2 which means there are two pods that have been created. You can check the same by listing the PODs

kubectl --context2 cluster2 get pod  -n kube-system
You can check on which nodes these are created on

kubectl --context2 cluster2 get pod <pod-name> -n kube-system -o wide
Under NODE you will find the node name, so we can see that its not scheduled on the controlplane node which is because it must be missing the reqiured tolerations. Let's edit the DaemonSet to fix the tolerations

kubectl --context2 cluster2 edit ds logs-cka26-trb -n kube-system
Under tolerations: add below given tolerations as well

- key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
  operator: Exists
  effect: NoSchedule
Wait for some time PODs should schedule on all nodes now including the controlplane node.

===========================

Part I:

Create a ClusterIP service .i.e. service-3421-svcn in the spectra-1267 ns which should expose the pods namely pod-23 and pod-21 with port set to 8080 and targetport to 80.

Part II:

Store the pod names and their ip addresses from the spectra-1267 ns at /root/pod_ips_cka05_svcn where the output is sorted by their IP's.

Please ensure the format as shown below:



POD_NAME        IP_ADDR
pod-1           ip-1
pod-3           ip-2
pod-2           ip-3
...

The easiest way to route traffic to a specific pod is by the use of labels and selectors . List the pods along with their labels:



student-node ~ ➜  kubectl get pods --show-labels -n spectra-1267
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
pod-12   1/1     Running   0          5m21s   env=dev,mode=standard,type=external
pod-34   1/1     Running   0          5m20s   env=dev,mode=standard,type=internal
pod-43   1/1     Running   0          5m20s   env=prod,mode=exam,type=internal
pod-23   1/1     Running   0          5m21s   env=dev,mode=exam,type=external
pod-32   1/1     Running   0          5m20s   env=prod,mode=standard,type=internal
pod-21   1/1     Running   0          5m20s   env=prod,mode=exam,type=external



Looks like there are a lot of pods created to confuse us. But we are only concerned with the labels of pod-23 and pod-21.



As we can see both the required pods have labels mode=exam,type=external in common. Let's confirm that using kubectl too:



student-node ~ ➜  kubectl get pod -l mode=exam,type=external -n spectra-1267                                    
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-23   1/1     Running   0          9m18s
pod-21   1/1     Running   0          9m17s



Nice!! Now as we have figured out the labels, we can proceed further with the creation of the service:



student-node ~ ➜  kubectl create service clusterip service-3421-svcn -n spectra-1267 --tcp=8080:80 --dry-run=client -o yaml > service-3421-svcn.yaml



Now modify the service definition with selectors as required before applying to k8s cluster:



student-node ~ ➜  cat service-3421-svcn.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: service-3421-svcn
  name: service-3421-svcn
  namespace: spectra-1267
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 8080-80
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: service-3421-svcn  # delete 
    mode: exam    # add
    type: external  # add
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}



Finally let's apply the service definition:



student-node ~ ➜  kubectl apply -f service-3421-svcn.yaml
service/service-3421 created

student-node ~ ➜  k get ep service-3421-svcn -n spectra-1267
NAME           ENDPOINTS                     AGE
service-3421   10.42.0.15:80,10.42.0.17:80   52s



To store all the pod name along with their IP's , we could use imperative command as shown below:



student-node ~ ➜  kubectl get pods -n spectra-1267 -o=custom-columns='POD_NAME:metadata.name,IP_ADDR:status.podIP' --sort-by=.status.podIP

POD_NAME   IP_ADDR
pod-12     10.42.0.18
pod-23     10.42.0.19
pod-34     10.42.0.20
pod-21     10.42.0.21
...
# store the output to /root/pod_ips
student-node ~ ➜  kubectl get pods -n spectra-1267 -o=custom-columns='POD_NAME:metadata.name,IP_ADDR:status.podIP' --sort-by=.status.podIP > /root/pod_ips_cka05_svcn
